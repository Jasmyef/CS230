Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The client was The Gaming Room, and they wanted a web-based version of their game “Draw It or Lose It” that works on phones, tablets, and computers. The game needed to be fun, fair, and easy to use for teams playing from different locations.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I explained everything in a way that was easy to follow and covered both the technical side and the user experience. I also did well laying out how the game should work across different platforms.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
It helped me stay organized and think through each part of the project before writing any code. It also made sure I understood what the game needed to do before building it.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I’d probably revise the architecture section and add more detail about how everything connects. I would include a diagram or visuals to help explain the structure better.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I made sure the game was simple to use, allowed teams to form easily, and worked on any device. It’s important to design with users in mind so the app is actually helpful and enjoyable for the people using it.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
I started by thinking about how the user would interact with the game and broke everything into smaller, manageable parts. In the future, I’d keep using design patterns like Singleton and include more mockups or flowcharts to guide the process.
